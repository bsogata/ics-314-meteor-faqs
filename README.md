# ICS 314 Meteor FAQs

This project is intended to:

* Answer the questions that students have regarding Meteor for [E48: meteor-application-template-react](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314s19/morea/meteor-2/experience-meteor-application-template-react.html)
* Provide an example of a GitHub Pages site for the same students to refer to

This may fail at both objectives.

The aforementioned GitHub Pages site is available at [https://bsogata.github.io/ics-314-meteor-faqs](https://bsogata.github.io/ics-314-meteor-faqs).  The site uses the Minimal theme to reflect the amount of thought that the author put into some of this.

  * Send Branden a message on Slack asking to be added as a collaborator on this project
  * Clone the repository to your computer
  * Make a new branch for your work
  * Change _index.md_ or _README.md_ as needed
  * Make a Git commit with a message describing your changes
  * Push your commit (and branch) to GitHub
  * Send a message on Slack to @branden_ogata so I can look through your changes and merge them into the `master` branch
    * You will learn about pull requests in a few weeks, but this process will be fine for now
