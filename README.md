# ICS 314 Meteor FAQs

This project is intended to:

* Answer the questions that students have regarding Meteor for [E48: meteor-application-template-react](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314s19/morea/meteor-2/experience-meteor-application-template-react.html)
* Provide an example of a GitHub Pages site for the same students to refer to

This may fail at both tasks.

The aforementioned GitHub Pages site is available at [https://bsogata.github.io/ics-314-meteor-faqs](https://bsogata.github.io/ics-314-meteor-faqs).  The site uses the Slate theme because that is when the majority of Computer Science students are actually working.
